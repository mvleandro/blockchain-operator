spec:
  # Here is the magic: we only define the INTENTION of the node.
  # The operator will automatically set up Geth (snap) + Prysm.
  nodeType: full

  # Choose the network: mainnet, sepolia, or holesky
  network: "sepolia"

  # Number of replicas (Pods)
  replicas: 1

  # Disk size. 
  # For a Full Node on Sepolia or Mainnet, I recommend at least 500Gi of SSD/NVMe.
  storageSize: "500Gi"

  # Checkpoint Sync: Essential for the node to become "Ready" in minutes, not days.
  # This endpoint is public and reliable for the Sepolia network.
  checkpointSyncURL: "https://sepolia.beaconstate.info"

  # Recommended resources for a stable Full Node
  resources:
    requests:

      memory: "4Gi" # 4GB RAM guaranteed
    limits:
      cpu: "4000m"  # Up to 4 vCPUs at peak
